Binary executable files of the "7za" archiver, designed exclusively only for Linux set-top boxes, based on the Enigma2 (GUI), for the following chipsets (intended only for the specified CPUs !!!). You can find out the CPU architecture via Shell: `uname -m`.

v9.20:

- 7za_mips32el (32bit) = mipsel | mips32el | mips-el | ...
- 7za_cortexa15hf-neon-vfpv4 (32bit) = arm | arm7l | armhf | ...

v16.02:

- 7za_aarch64 (64bit) = arm64
- 7za_sh4 (32bit) = sh4 | sh_4 (SuperH 4, less common RISC processor, used in old game consoles for its graphics performance)
